This is Lachlan Teale's latest personal website showcasing his skills, projects and personality. The previous version can be found [here](https://github.com/MrTeale/personal_website).

**The website is live at [lachlanteale.com](www.lachlanteale.com)**

## Built With
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


## Local Development

Clone the repo and ensure you're at the top level before following the next commands

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This runs the website in development mode with lazy reloading. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.

## Build/Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production in the build folder. It correctly bundles React and TailwindCSS in production and optimizes the build for best performance and cleans it of uncessary junk.

This application is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) through continuous deployment on the git repo's master branch.
